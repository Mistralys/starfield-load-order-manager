# Starfield Load Order Manager

**WIP**

Windows app for simple load order management in existing saves:
Adding mods during a playthrough means that the load order should
not be modified anymore (at least for mods that add new content).

Run this tool after adding new mods to ensure that the load order
stays stable.
